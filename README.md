# FTSO

Songbird/Flare FTSO server.

## Development
<!-- First follow the `Getting Started` instructions in the [FTSO npm example package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/ftso_price_provider_kick_off_package) to get your local environment ready. -->

### Initial Setup
Clone this repository.

Install dependencies (if not already present):
- [Node](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html)
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install node
npm install --global yarn
```

Switch to the repo folder (`cd ftso`) and run `yarn`.

Then setup an `.env` file following `.env example` with the following:
- Songbird/Flare node (see https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/node-config)
- CryptoCompare API key
- [CoinAPI Key](https://www.coinapi.io/Pricing)
- [CoinMarketCap Key](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/)
- Your price provider private key
- Gmail access credentials ([instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?p=InvalidSecondFactor&visit_id=637687407469912796-3308787284&rd=1))
and call `source .env` in your terminal.
- Email list for error messages
- If CCXT is the price source, then you must fill in your exchanges source/s of choice in the following format: `EXCHANGE_SOURCE = "coinbasepro, binance, ftx, huobi, kucoin, gateio, okex"` this allows for dynamic source selection during initialization
- BASE_CURRENCY: the base currency, e.g. USD
- BASE_CURRENCY_ALTS (comma separated list with space): alternative base pairs that will be converted to BASE_CURRENCY
- VOLUME_WEIGHT: whether to weight prices from different sources by reported volume
- USE_SYSTEM_TIME: whether to use system time or blockchain time (TRUE/FALSE)
- SUBMIT_BUFFER_MIN: minimum submit buffer, or, if CONSTANT_BUFFER='TRUE', then the constant submission buffer
- CONSTANT_BUFFER: whether to use a constant or dynamic buffer


To run
```
cd src_prod
npm install
npm run build
node ./dist/prod-price-provider.js
```

Or with yarn:
```
cd src_prod
yarn
yarn build
node ./dist/prod-price-provider.js
```

Anytime changes are made, `yarn build` or equivalent must be rerun (or you can use the `yarn runFromBuild` custom command).

Ensure .env is properly placed in the `src_prod` folder.

To get logging of run output, use:
```
node ./dist/prod-price-provider.js 2>&1 | tee -a run.log
tail -f run.log
```

To run the main process in the background, use `screen` ([Explanation](https://askubuntu.com/questions/8653/how-to-keep-processes-running-after-ending-ssh-session/8657#8657)).


## Production

### Docker

Build the image in project root directory: `docker build .` then push to docker hub: `docker push bbftso/ftsojs`. Note that the images need to be tagged before pushing: `docker tag image_hash bbftso/ftsojs`:

```
cd src_prod
docker build .
docker image ls
docker tag [image_hash] bbftso/ftsojs:[TAG]
docker push bbftso/ftsojs:[TAG]
```

### Deployment
Make sure docker-compose and docker are installed on the instance.

On a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 instance:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install docker
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

Make a new directory:
```
mkdir ftso
cd ftso
```

Copy over a `docker-compose.yml` file to the instance ([template](https://github.com/mczochowski/ftso/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)).

Setup the enviornment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file similarly to the `.env` file *without quotes* (update docker-compose.yml to pull from `bbftso/ftsojs:[TAG]` using the tag set above or a standard tag), then run: 

```
sudo docker-compose pull
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

To see the `docker-compose` logs, run:
```
sudo docker-compose logs
```

The monitoring process should check the status every minute, logs are written to `./logs/run.log`
